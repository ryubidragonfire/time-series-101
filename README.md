# Applications
- **forecasting**
- **pattern recognition**
- **fill in missing data**
- **analysis**: understanding of the underlying structure of the signal

# Data Preparation
What needed to be done before analysing or pass on to an algorithm?
- ? aligning to the same starting point?
- ? normalise to the same scale by down sampling?
- ? how to deal with missing data? link back to one of the **applications** above?
